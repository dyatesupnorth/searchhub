                    ## Welcome to freeCodeCamp's open source codebase and curriculum!
                    
                    freeCodeCamp is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://donate.freecodecamp.org) with the goal of helping millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job.
                    
                    Our full stack web development curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.
                    
                    ### Certifications
                    
                    freeCodeCamp offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take beginner programmers around 300 hours to earn.
                    
                    Each of these 30 project in the freeCodeCamp curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally, and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before submitting it.
                    
                    You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp's CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Glitch - or even on your local development environment.
                    
                    Once youâve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or rÃ©sumÃ©. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, theyâll see a verified certification specific to you.
                    
                    The one exception to this is in the event that we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/academic-honesty). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

## Welcome to freeCodeCamp's open source codebase and curriculum!

freeCodeCamp is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://donate.freecodecamp.org) with the goal of helping millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full stack web development curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take beginner programmers around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 30 project in the freeCodeCamp curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally, and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before submitting it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp's CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Glitch - or even on your local development environment.

Once youâve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or rÃ©sumÃ©. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, theyâll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is in the event that we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/academic-honesty). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

Here are our six core certifications:

#### 1. Responsive Web Design Certification

              ## Welcome to freeCodeCamp's open source codebase and curriculum!
              
              freeCodeCamp is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://donate.freecodecamp.org) with the goal of helping millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job.
              
              Our full stack web development curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.
              
              ### Certifications
              
              freeCodeCamp offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take beginner programmers around 300 hours to earn.
              
              Each of these 30 project in the freeCodeCamp curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally, and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before submitting it.
              
              You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp's CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Glitch - or even on your local development environment.
              
              Once youâve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or rÃ©sumÃ©. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, theyâll see a verified certification specific to you.
              
              The one exception to this is in the event that we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/academic-honesty). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.
